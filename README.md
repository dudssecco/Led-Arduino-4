# ðŸ”¹ Parallel LED Control

Why blink LEDs one by one when you can run them in parallel and show off your multitasking skills? This project turns on two LEDs simultaneously, because why not give the impression that youâ€™ve mastered both time and technology?

## Technologies Utilized:

- Arduino (C/C++)
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Parallel Circuit Logic
